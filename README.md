This project examines the factors influencing football matches ending in draws, specifically within the Czech league from 2014 to 2024. 

The project employs statistical methods, such as probit regression, to identify significant predictors of match outcomes, focusing on variables like goals, passes, and cards.

In our analysis, we identify a  relationship between match outcomes and game dynamics, employing variables such as shots, attacks, and yellow cards, which, intriguingly, elevate the likelihood of a match concluding in a draw. This contrasts with our initial hypotheses, particularly noting the counterintuitive positive impact of aggressive play and offensive strategies on draw probabilities. Additionally, goals, especially those occurring in the latter stages of a match (represented by G1p and G2p variables), markedly reduce the draw probability, underscoring the decisive nature of late-game events. Through probit regression, we meticulously dissect these interactions, revealing the intricate balance between various aspects of gameplay and their collective influence on drawing a match.

You can choose between two files. First one uses the most recent data, while having one minute delay because of data scapping and the other one has our data downloaded on 22.1.2024.

Our workload is differs a bit from the GitHub records as we had to improvise. Jakub Pavlovsky did most of the modeling and Jan Hemer transctipted the code to functions. Jan Hemer also did the data scrapping and the part of visualization. Our contribution is 50% for both.
